Well, it seems like Gro is telling the truth. He insists he did not harm the children and another child went missing last night!
*[Don't worry Harold. I'll continue looking for the children. The job is not over.]
    Thank you Revna. I don't know what we would have done had you not come around.
    **[I'm glad I can help. Any ideas where to start now?]
        Well, if you think the children went to the forest start there!
        ***[Okay. Good idea.] -> DONE
